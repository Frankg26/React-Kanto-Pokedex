# React Kanto Pokédex

This repository contains a web application that showcases random Pokémon from the original 151. It utilizes React on the frontend and Express on the backend.

In a future version, users will be able to search by Pokémon name and save a party of six Pokémon on MongoDB. The application will also be hosted online.

Before using this application, ensure that you install all dependencies in both the server and client directories via the CLI by running the command `npm install` in both directories.

To use the current build, download the repository and follow these steps:

1. In a CLI window, navigate to the server directory and run the command `node server.js`
2. In a new CLI window, navigate to the client directory and run the command `npm start`
3. In your browser, go to `http://localhost:3000/`
