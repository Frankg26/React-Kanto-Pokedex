# React Kanto Pokédex

This repository contains a web application that showcases random Pokémon from the original 151. It utilizes React on the frontend and Express on the backend.

In a future version, users will be able to search by Pokémon name and save a party of six Pokémon on MongoDB. 

Before using this application, ensure that you install all dependencies in both the server and client directories via the CLI by running the command `npm install` in both directories.

To use the current build, download the repository and follow these steps:

1. In a CLI window, navigate to the server directory and run the command `npm start`
2. In your browser, go to `http://localhost:8080/`
